    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "**Goal:** While the previous chapters focused on algorithms and code, this notebook focuses on **Process**. This is a comprehensive checklist derived from the book to guide you through any Machine Learning project, ensuring you don't miss critical steps—from framing the problem to deploying the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The 8 Main Steps:**\n",
    "1.  **Frame the Problem:** Define the objective and look at the big picture.\n",
    "2.  **Get the Data:** Find, gather, and explore the data.\n",
    "3.  **Explore the Data:** Gain insights and visualize correlations.\n",
    "4.  **Prepare the Data:** Clean and transform the data for ML algorithms.\n",
    "5.  **Shortlist Models:** Train many quick-and-dirty models to find promising candidates.\n",
    "6.  **Fine-Tune:** Tune hyperparameters and combine models.\n",
    "7.  **Present:** Document and communicate your solution.\n",
    "8.  **Launch:** Deploy, monitor, and maintain the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Utility:**\n",
    "* This notebook includes **Reusable Code Templates** for common tasks like data downloading, structure setup, and correlation analysis."
