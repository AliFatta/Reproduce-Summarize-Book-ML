    "\n",
    "### 1. Structure of a Tree\n",
    "* **Root Node:** The top node where the tree starts.\n",
    "* **Split Node:** A node that checks a condition (e.g., \"Petal length <= 2.45 cm\") and splits the data.\n",
    "* **Leaf Node:** A terminal node that does not have children. It holds the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Gini Impurity\n",
    "A node's \"impurity\" measures how mixed the training instances are in that node. A node is \"pure\" (Gini = 0) if all instances it applies to belong to the same class.\n",
    "$$ G_i = 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{n} p_{i,k}^2 $$\n",
    "Where $p_{i,k}$ is the ratio of class $k$ instances among the training instances in the $i$-th node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The CART Algorithm\n",
    "Scikit-Learn uses the **Classification And Regression Tree (CART)** algorithm. It is a \"greedy\" algorithm: it searches for the single best pair of feature $k$ and threshold $t_k$ that produces the purest subsets (weighted by their size). It repeats this recursively until it reaches `max_depth` or cannot find a split that reduces impurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. White Box vs. Black Box\n",
    "* **White Box (Decision Trees):** Easy to interpret. You can visualize exactly why a decision was made.\n",
    "* **Black Box (Neural Networks, SVMs):** Often perform better, but hard to explain why specific predictions were made."

For example, it might find that `Petal Length <= 2.45` perfectly separates the *Setosa* flowers from the rest. It creates a node for this rule. Then it looks at the remaining data (Versicolor and Virginica) and finds the next best split (e.g., `Petal Width <= 1.75`).\n",

    "1. Start at root: Is length <= 2.45? No.\n",
    "2. Go to right child: Is width <= 1.75? Yes (assuming 1.5 < 1.75).\n",
    "3. Reach leaf node: This node contains mostly Versicolor.\n",
    "4. Output: Class Versicolor (and the probability is the % of Versicolor in that leaf).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Regression\n",

    "**Process:** The tree splits the $X$ axis into regions (e.g., $X < 0.2$, $0.2 \\le X < 0.8$, etc.).\n",
    "**Output:** For any new instance falling into a specific region, the tree predicts the **average** $y$-value of the training instances in that region. This results in the \"staircase\" (step function) appearance of the red line in the plot."

    "* **Orthogonal Boundaries:** Trees make splits perpendicular to the feature axes. This makes them sensitive to data rotation (e.g., if you rotate the dataset 45 degrees, the staircase boundary becomes messy).\n",
    "* **Instability:** Trees are sensitive to small variations in the training data. A small change can result in a completely different tree structure. This is solved by averaging many trees (Random Forests).\n",
    "* **Overfitting:** Being non-parametric models, they love to overfit. Always use regularization parameters like `max_depth` or `min_samples_leaf`."
